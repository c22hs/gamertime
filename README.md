# Harrison And Charlie's Snake Project
We made this project with the only inspiration being Charlie's caterpillar sprite from a prior glitch project(which we ended up majority scrapping) and a later idea, Snake. 

In writing our code we did not take any code from any other projects same with sprites all of our code and inspiration came from our minds and things like the A-Frame repository and common questions on stackoverflow where we did not copy code but instead saw how code worked and repurposed it for our own project with many many altercations.

Things like our snake logic and movement are personally thought up by Charlie and myself and all of the sprites and text and everything is done by us. 

A lot of our code took many thinking sessions to make and a few weekend multi hour working sessions as well. 

Charlie and I have leared a LOT and when I say A LOT i mean it about aframe, js, html, and things like repl github and glitch. 

Some notable advancements in knowledge:
- Key detection
- Js ARRAYS
- JS Global Variables
- Primitives in html
- Collision (kind of)
- live movement with things like set and clear interval
- reverse array movement
- Refrencing HTML sprites and objects in JS and modifying/creating them
- Learning JS functions and how they work in A-Frame
- Learning how to make things work without the initialization function and Register Component
- 3d text
- Camera Rotation and control
